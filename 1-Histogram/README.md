# Histogram Processing

[`HistEqualDemo.ipynb`](./HistEqualDemo.ipynb) and [`HistSpecDemo.ipynb`](./HistSpecDemo.ipynb) show how to do histogram equalization and histogram specification using functions implemented in [`utils.py`](./utils.py).

[`HideSecret.ipynb`](./HideSecret.ipynb) is inspired by part of [the puzzle](https://github.com/PKU-GeekGame/geekgame-1st/tree/master/writeups/MaxXing) from [1st PKU GeekGame](https://github.com/PKU-GeekGame/geekgame-1st). It shows one of the many interesting uses of histogram processing.
